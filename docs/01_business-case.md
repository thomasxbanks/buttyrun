# The Business Case

## The Purpose

The idea behind this software is to make the regular ordering of the Friday Butty Run easier to manage.

### The current process
1. One person emails, texts, and/or Slacks everyone in the office, depending on which communication method they use, asking if they want a butty picking up.
1. One person then purchases sandwiches for all the people who have replied by the time they get to the shop.
1. One person then collects money from the purchasers in exchange for their butty.

### Issues with the current process
1. No centralised communication method.
1. Relies on either the organiser remembering what each person wants from the last order or asking everyone what they want each time.
1. Relies on either getting a receipt from the shop (and really, how many bacon butty shops do receipts?!) or remembering what each sandwich cost and getting the right money from each purchaser.
1. Leads to mistakes in sandwich make up.
1. Leads to people not replying in time (if the orderer doesn't have their mobile number, etc.) and not getting a butty if they want one.

### Current solutions to these Issues
1. Using a note-taking app, such as Google Keep to make notes or just checking email/slack/texts whilst ordering in the shop

### How can we make this better?
The idea behind this is to create a centralised communication method that also stores a purchaser's preferred butty and allows a simple one-tap 'geg in on this run' response method. How I envisage it working is that, for the purchaser, they get a push notification at 8.30 on a Friday asking if they want in on the run. Select _yes_ to order the same thing as last time, select _no_ to opt out, select _change_ to order a different butty. The person in the shop then has a list of the people who have opted in with their selection in one place.

### Extensions
By replacing __butty__ with __brew__ would allow this to work for regular brew runs. Whoever is going to make the drinks sends a push notification, everyone else opts-in or opts-out and the brew-maker gets a list of who wants what - no more forgetting if Janet takes sugar or accidentally putting milk in Thom's coffee!
